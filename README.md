# Simpledandy

Welcome to **Simpledandy**, a glimpse into my evolving development journey! This repository is a placeholder for my future configuration files and a reflection of my ongoing exploration in the world of software development.

## About Me

I'm a university student with a deep interest in programming and solving real-world challenges through technology. My learning journey is driven by curiosity and a desire to experiment with new tools, frameworks, and languages.

### Current Endeavors
- **Yechim**: A problem-solving app designed to empower users to tackle challenges creatively and efficiently. This project represents my aspirations to create impactful, user-friendly applications.
- Broad experimentation across **languages and frameworks**, including:
  - **Languages**: C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and more!
  - **Frameworks/Tools**: Flask, React Native, Rad Studio, and even a brief dabble in Android Studio (though my laptop had other opinions).  
- Proud owner of **20+ certificates** on [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com) showcasing my foundational knowledge across multiple programming domains.

### Learning & Goals
While Iâ€™ve mostly been experimenting with various tools and technologies, Iâ€™m passionate about mastering:
- Building intuitive, scalable apps (Yechim is just the start!).
- Gaining deeper expertise in frameworks like Flask and React Native.
- Contributing to open-source projects and engaging with the developer community.

## Future Plans
Though this repository is sparse for now, I plan to:
- Add configuration files as I begin to use tools purposefully and consistently (stay tuned!).
- Share more about my projects and document my development journey.
